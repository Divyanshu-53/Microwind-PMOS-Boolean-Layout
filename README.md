# Microwind-PMOS-Boolean-Layout
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Boolean expression using PMOS-only transistors in Microwind. It includes Boolean simplification, gate-level design, transistor-level schematic, stick diagram, Microwind layout, and simulation analysis with results and comparisons to CMOS

# PMOS-Only Boolean Function Layout Design (Microwind)

This repository contains the **VLSI Special Assignment Project** where a Boolean function is implemented **using only PMOS transistors**. The project includes the Boolean function derivation, gate-level diagram, transistor-level schematic, stick diagram, Microwind layout, and simulation results.

## üìå Project Overview
- **Boolean Function Implemented**:  
  \[
  F = AB' + C(D' + A)
  \]  
  Rewritten and optimized for PMOS-only design:  
  \[
  F = \bigl((A' + B)(C' + D A')\bigr)'
  \]

- **Tools Used**:  
  - Microwind (layout and simulation)  
  - LaTeX (report preparation)  
  - Circuitikz (schematics in LaTeX)  

- **Key Learning Points**:  
  - Designing logic using PMOS-only implementation.  
  - Understanding duality and De Morgan transformations for transistor mapping.  
  - Creating stick diagrams and layouts in Microwind.  
  - Measuring rise time, fall time, propagation delay, and power.
