# Microwind-PMOS-Boolean-Layout
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Boolean expression using PMOS-only transistors in Microwind. It includes Boolean simplification, gate-level design, transistor-level schematic, stick diagram, Microwind layout, and simulation analysis with results and comparisons to CMOS
